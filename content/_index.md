Hi, I am Jordan,

I am a software engineer, passionate about all things at the intersection of programming, computer
science, and mathematics.

These days, I am doing research in graphics for Imagination Technologies (better known under its
previous moniker "VideoLogic" by the ~older~ more experienced gamers and game developers).

I have previously worked at Gravity Sketch, where I contributed to building the geometry kernel of
the eponymous application, a collaborative, VR, 3D modeling tool.

Before that, I was --- or more accurately, tried to be --- a mathematician, and studied stuff related to symbolic dynamics and thermodynamic
formalism.

This is a place for me to ramble about professional and personal projects, hope you enjoy your stay!
